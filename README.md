## Description

**Knight's Travails** is a Javascript project that explores the intriguing problem of finding the shortest path for a knight on an 8x8 chessboard. The project implements a specialized data structure akin to a binary tree to discover the optimal sequence of moves for the knight's journey.

In chess, the knight is known for its unique L-shaped movement â€“ two steps in one direction followed by one step perpendicular to that. This project delves into the knight's versatile and fascinating ability to reach any square on the chessboard from any other square, provided there are enough turns to do so.

## The Challenge

The primary objective of this project is to develop the `knightMoves` function, a tool that calculates and visualizes the shortest feasible route for a knight to traverse from one square to another. The function reveals all the squares where the knight will make a stop along the way.
